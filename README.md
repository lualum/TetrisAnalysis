# Tetris Analysis Project

A modern **Tetris gameplay analysis engine** inspired by chess engines and post-game chess analysis tools.

This project uses modern guideline Tetris mechanics — including **Super Rotation System (SRS)** and configurable **DAS/ARR handling**.
By integrating **Misamino** and the **Tetris Bot Protocol (TBP)**, it provides engine-backed move analysis and performance metrics similar to what engines like Stockfish provide for chess.
